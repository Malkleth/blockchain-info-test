1) create git repo, clone to my local xampp directory
2) copy and tweak index.php from https://github.com/Malkleth/kivaapitest to build a basic table of the blockchain data
3) load up some javascript and css formatting tools I used in UltimateDonations.org's admin section.
I didn't create this sortable javascript table, but it works really well, I have a page that uses it with 18k entries and it's really fast. We got it from: https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/
Downside: when using it, row limitation is best applied at the database limit level, but passing in that sort of stuff with ajax is simple enough.

5) commit to git repo

6) add heroku procfile, recommit.

7) deploy to heroku

8) cleanup pass on index.php
